# README

## Assumptions

* Stats show progress towards goal, i.e. they are a snapshot and are not cumulative

## Dev notes

* For MVP goal editing API (and tracking recalculation) is not provided
  instead members can update goals by deleting and creating new ones with 
  new relevant values

* It's a good idea to use DatabaseCleaner with rspec, skipped to save time
